# Publish Queue Manager plugin for Movable Type

This plugin provides a simple user interface in the Movable Type administrative
system to view, change priority, and delete publishing jobs from the built-in
"Publish Queue" system -- a system by which files are published in the
background. Keeping an eye on what is publishing is a great way to understand
what is happening at any given time!

# Prerequisites

* Movable Type 4.2 or later
* Movable Type 5.2.6 or later

# Installation

# Usage

To view and manage your queue, visit the Tools > Publish Queue Jobs menu option
that is accessible from the System Dashboard (Manage > Publish Queue Jobs in
MT4). In MT4, Publish Queue Jobs can also be found in the System Overview menu
in the upper-right of the screen.

A spinning icon displayed next to the Priority column indicates that job is
currently being processed.

Deleting jobs and changing their priority is pretty simple: select a job (or
jobs) and click the Delete button or choose the More Actions... Change Priority
option.
